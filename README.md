# duitku
This "Duitku" project is an Android app project for our "Software Engineering" assignment in Binus University. Duitku is a small finance management app that can help users to manage and track their incomes and expenses. There're also another features such as budgeting, notification, data visualization with pie chart, article, set pascode, and many more.


This app uses two databases: SQLite and Firestore database. We use SQLite because it's the Android default database built-in. We use Firestore to store the users data in the cloud so they won't lose their data if the app is uninstalled or their phone is missing. We always track both SQLite and Firestore database so the data is the same and up-to-date. The Firestore database is regularly backed up every 6 hours (with JobScheduler)


We also include AdMob, notification when the budget is exceeded, passcode system, and more.
